# NumericalOperations

## Introduction
In this lab you will apply numerical operations to perform calculation and print the results to the console

## Code Challenge 1

- [ ] In the ModulusCalc class, write an algorithm that prints the modulus of any positive integer, without using the modulus operator.  Below is sample assignments for the integer and modulus and the corresponding output, 

|  number | modulus  | result |
|---|---|---|
| 1234  | 10  | 4 |
| 101010  | 2  | 0 |
| -2312  | 33  | 2 |

## Code Challenge 2

- [ ] Create a new java class called NumReverse.java
 
- [ ] Implement the number reversal code you wrote in the group portion of this lab.  Your code should work for any 4 digit integer.  When your code is ran the original and the reversed number should print to the console.  Consider the examples below, 

|  number | result  |
|---|---|
| 1234  | 1234 --> 4321  |
| 6789  | 6789 --> 9876  |
| 1080  | 1080 --> 0801  |

## Code Challenge 3

- [ ] In the Time class, implement a 24 hour to 12 hour time converter.  The 24 hour clock is a clock that starts at time 0 and ends as time 24.  Below is a chart that shows the conversions from a 24 hour clock to a 12 hour clock.  In your program do not worry about the am/pm designation. 

|  24 hour | 12 hour  |
|---|---|
| 1  | 1 am |
| 2  | 2 am |
| 3  | 3 am |
| 4  | 4 am |
| 5  | 5 am |
| 6  | 6 am |
| 7  | 7 am |
| 8  | 8 am |
| 9  | 9 am |
| 10  | 10 am  |
| 11  | 11 am  |
| 12  | 12 pm  |
| 13  | 1 pm  |
| 14  | 2 pm  |
| 15  | 3 pm  |
| 16  | 4 pm  |
| 17  | 5 pm  |
| 18  | 6 pm  |
| 19  | 7 pm  |
| 20  | 8 pm  |
| 21  | 9 pm  |
| 22  | 10 pm |
| 23  | 11 pm |
